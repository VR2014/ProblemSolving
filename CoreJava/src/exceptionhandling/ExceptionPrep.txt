Exception Handling in Java
---------------------------

Exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disturbs the flow of execution.

Types of Exceptions:
- Checked Exceptions (Compile-time exceptions): Must be caught or declared in the method signature.
- Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions): Do not need to be declared or handled explicitly.

Exception Handling Mechanism:
- try: Code that might throw an exception is placed inside this block.
- catch: This block catches exceptions thrown by the try block and allows for handling or logging.
- finally: This block executes regardless of whether an exception occurred, allowing for cleanup actions.

Stack Trace:
- Exception name: The type of the exception that occurred.
- Exception message: A description of the exception.
- Line number: The line in the code where the exception was thrown.
- Method info: Information about the method where the exception occurred.

Throw and throws :
- throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception, which stops the execution.
- throws: Used in method signatures to declare that a method might throw a checked exception.
